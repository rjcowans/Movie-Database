# Movie-Database
Movie Database using Python and Java

In order to properly simulate the code. 

One would need to run https://github.com/rjcowans/Movie-Database/blob/master/src/Data_Exfil/Extractor.py

Using the two csv found in the folder at -> https://github.com/rjcowans/Movie-Database/tree/master/inputse

The Extractor will pipe out 6 csv that need to be in the same working directory as the java file

Once a MySQL Datbase is Required. 

**Adivise, I used default creds as an example, but locally this would be kept secret and changed**

After that one would need the **mssql-jdbc-7.2.1.jre8.jar** from -> https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

Then One can complile and run the java application

Thank you for you time.
